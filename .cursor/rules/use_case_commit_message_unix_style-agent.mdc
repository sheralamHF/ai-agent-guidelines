# UNIX Style Commit Message Rule

## Critical Rules

- The commit message **title (subject line) must be 50 characters or fewer**.
- The title must be **capitalized**, written in the **imperative mood**, and **must not end with a period**.
- The **second line must be blank**.
- The **body (if present) must wrap at 72 characters per line**.
- The body should explain **what** and **why**, not **how**.
- Use bullet points in the body if listing changes.
- Use an optional footer for breaking changes or issue references.
- Reject commit messages that do not comply with these rules.
- Create multiple smaller commits instead of 1 single commit with all the changes
- **Must not Push the changes**, ask before you push commits to origin
- Print which branch you are committing to.
- Create a new branch if you are on `master` or `main` branch.
- **Never make commit on `master` or `main` branch.**
